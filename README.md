# Dahlia Detector
The Dahlia Detector is a website built on Flask that uses Machine learning to categorize and store images of Dahlias

## Functionality:
 - Supports account creation
 - Users are able to upload pictures of dahlias which are then categorized and stored

## Improvements
- Use types of Dahlias instead of categories of Dahlias in Keras model
- Increase confidence of machine learning model (perhaps by using a larger training dataset, adding more layers, etc.)
- Add some sort of 'progress tracker' to show how many types of dahlias you have uploaded
